Creating Mesh Slots for customizable characters:

1. Rig character as one complete mesh.
2. Properly do skin weights
3. Once skinned, delete portions of mesh to create proper slot mesh.  DO NOT DELETE SKELETON!!!
4. Save AS the new mesh into a different file.
5. Reopen unified mesh and repeat process for other slots.

For reference, take a look at UMA wolf.  Rigged meshes with the same skeleton merge the skeletons together.
